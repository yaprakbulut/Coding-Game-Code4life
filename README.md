Robot move to diagnosis because of no carried sample and current location different from target.
On diagnosis module, if robot doesn't carry sample, find which sample has max health.
If found doesn't carried by other robot, our robot take sample.
Check it; is robot carrying sample, location and target are not equal than, go to target.
Robot collect all molecules from molecules module until carried number of carried molecules is not smaller than samples needed number of molecules.
When all molecules collected, check to the is location equal to target .
If they are not equal robot move to laboratory and check is sample carryed then again check location and target if all contidions correct, robot connect for give sample to laboratory.
Check location and target again, move diagnosis and all steps uses over again.
